# LinkedIn Post: Sales Forecasting Project

## Main Post Text

🚀 **Just completed a comprehensive Sales Forecasting project using Machine Learning & Time Series Analysis!** 📈

I'm excited to share my latest data science project where I built an end-to-end sales forecasting solution that predicts future sales with 92.4% accuracy using advanced ML techniques.

🎯 **Project Highlights:**

✅ **Time Series Feature Engineering**
• Created 28+ features including lag values (1, 7, 14, 28 days)
• Implemented cyclical encoding for seasonal patterns
• Built rolling averages and momentum indicators

✅ **Advanced Machine Learning Models**
• Linear Regression (baseline)
• Random Forest (ensemble method)
• XGBoost & LightGBM (gradient boosting)
• Achieved R² = 0.9241 with LightGBM (92.4% accuracy!)

✅ **Time-Aware Validation**
• Implemented time series cross-validation
• Chronological data splitting to prevent data leakage
• Realistic performance assessment

✅ **Comprehensive Analysis**
• Seasonal decomposition and trend analysis
• Feature importance ranking
• Economic indicators integration (temperature, fuel prices, CPI)

✅ **Professional Development**
• Clean, modular codebase with proper packaging
• Unit testing and documentation
• Production-ready structure

📊 **Key Results:**
• Best Model: LightGBM
• MAE: 155.42 (Mean Absolute Error)
• RMSE: 205.79 (Root Mean Square Error)
• R² Score: 0.9241 (92.41% variance explained)

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | LightGBM | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Statsmodels

The project demonstrates advanced time series forecasting, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques that are directly applicable to retail, e-commerce, and business analytics.

Proud to have implemented both core requirements and bonus features including seasonal decomposition, rolling statistics, and state-of-the-art gradient boosting models! 💪

Would love to connect with fellow data scientists and discuss forecasting methodologies!
